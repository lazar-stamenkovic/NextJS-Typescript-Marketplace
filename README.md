# Demo NFT Marketplace

### Goals:
- Concise code
- Well typed
- Modern react code using hooks + functional features
- Code can be easily refactored
- Easy for other developers to contribute and leverage the code
- Fast. Server side rendering as much as possible
- Extensible. Code in this project is useful in many dapps or as providing inspiration

### Tech stack:

*code*
- Typescript (default is JS [any type / untyped], typed where possible. Aiming for fully typed code a.k.a proper Typescript code)
*content frameworks*
- NextJs (React fairy dust. More is more. NextJs makes make aspects of react development a lot easier)

*styles*
- Tailwind CSS + PostCSS (Tailwind supplies CSS, postCSS is the preprocessor)

*ethereum dev tools*
- Hardhat (Based smart contracts dev suite)
- Ethers (Because it's the standard library to interact with blockchain and is a well trodden library many developers have already navigated)
- Web3Modal (It's nice yeah.. I'm not happy with the wallet integration code yet. It's a mess **WIP**)
